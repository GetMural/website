	<div>Visual storytelling is different from writing in text only, and we believe it requires a purpose-built tool to work with the richness and power of multimedia.
	<br><br>Mural is a tool for visual storytelling. It’s a program that helps you sequence your visual story, and then generates everything needed for that story to be displayed on most modern web browsers and served from any web server. 
	<br><br>When a story is made with Mural, its visual elements are displayed at full screen by default, letting the strength and richness of your work shine through. Images can be combined with sound, videos combined with text, and numerous other combinations are possible. Rearrange your sequences with a simple drag and drop.<br><br><h3>What you see is what you get</h3>See the way your story will look, test out all of the elements, and make changes if necessary before it’s uploaded to the web.</div>

	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-8 col-lg-6 text">
	                  <h3>Advertising and Marketing</h3>
					  Present your brand with greater impact, and bring your web and video assets closer together.<br>
	<br>
	<h3>Journalism</h3>
	Make better use of the power of visual storytelling. Present complex stories in long form with the strong visuals they deserve. Set your photo and video journalists free.<br>
	<br>
	<h3>Art</h3>
	Create compelling documentation for galleries, museums and individual artists. Present work in a more compelling manner.<br>
	<br>
	<h3>Storytelling</h3>Mural can be used effectively anywhere where a story needs to be told across media. Present your organization's stories in a visually powerful way quickly, easily and in a cost-effective manner.<br>

		<a href="https://stories.getmural.io/isisarts/forage" target="_blank">
			<img src="img/forage_640x480.jpg">
			<h2>Forage, by Henna Askainen</h2>
			<div>
				The idea for Forage came from Askainen's own experience of arriving in the North East of England from Finland and the rootedness she first began to feel when she had access to the countryside.
				<br>
				Forage is a participatory commission with refugees and asylum seekers now living in Newcastle and Gateshead. It is a series of walks and conversations in landscapes that are both strange and familiar. It provides the opportunity to discover and recover what it means to belong to a place when displaced from home and to experience the most ‘English’ of our landscapes at National Trust sites across Northumberland and Tyne and Wear. Using foraged plants, stories old and new are interwoven into new experiences for participants, and form the basis of a series public artworks and interventions.

		<a href="https://stories.getmural.io/isisarts/lapse" target="_blank">
			<img src="img/lapse_640x480.jpg">
			<h2>Lapse, by Matt Pickering</h2>
			<div>
				Told through the eyes of Martha, Lapse explores the ways our relationship with the world changes throughout the progress of Alzheimer’s disease.
				<br>
				Unfolding within her garden, Martha experiences a mosaic of personal memories from different moments in her life, collapsed into a continuous stream that blurs past and present; reality and artifice.

			<img src="img/blossomingincencebearingtrees_640x480.jpg">
			<h2>Blossoming Incence Bearing Trees, Or Unearthing His Roots, by Lulu MacDonald</h2>
			<div>
				Lulu MacDonald's work Blossoming Incence-Bearing Trees, Unearthing His Roots, is a 9-part site-specific exploration of how images are composed and understood. Taking the understandable symbol of a bouquet of flowers she reinterprets through metaphor, context and composition how we live within our still-lives within our own vases, live and consume, with the ever new recompositioning and transitioning between life and death, moving and stillness.

		<a href="https://stories.getmural.io/isisarts/european_ferries" target="_blank">
			<img src="img/european_ferries_640x480.jpg">
			<h2>European Ferries, by Willie Robb</h2>
			<div>
				European Ferries is a series of photographs which focuses on horizons and the UK's divisive cultural attitude towards them. Robb wanted to respond to the recent decision Britain has made to come out of the European Union. Physically the images depict historical links connecting the UK to its current continent but that is subject to change. Metaphorically the photographs consider horizons and our cultural attitude towards them.

			<h2>The Volunteers, by Dominic Smith</h2>
			<div>
				The Volunteers is an interview with Dave Bell, Captain, Director and Quatermaster of TVLP (Tynemouth Volunteer Life Brigade). Using videos of the Tynemouth coast and Bell's recollections, the piece serves as both oral history as well as visual poem of the northern British coastline.
